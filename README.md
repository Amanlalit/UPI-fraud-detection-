# UPI-fraud-detection-Using Machine Learning
This project showcases a full-stack web application aimed at detecting UPI (Unified Payments Interface) fraud through advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical transaction data, the system is capable of recognizing suspicious patterns and anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.

The application features an intuitive and interactive user interface, enabling users to input transaction information and receive immediate feedback on the likelihood of fraud. The backend is built on a robust framework that ensures efficient processing, secure data handling, and real-time analysis, while the responsive frontend guarantees a smooth and accessible user experience across devices.

A strong emphasis is placed on data privacy and security, following industry best practices to protect sensitive financial information. The result is a reliable and efficient tool that contributes to safer digital payments and instills trust among users by proactively safeguarding their financial transactions.
